# ScriptWorks

These are scripts that I have made to simplify my life.

## Description of each script

### Check if images are in respective folders.bat

This goes through my wallpaper folders and moves a wallpaper to its respective location if it's in the wrong folder.

```
ie. Phone wallpaper in desktop wallpaper folder? Move phone wallpaper to phone wallpaper folder. 
```

## Prerequisites

* Windows (These are bat scripts made for this OS.)

* [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/) (To run the image scripts.)
